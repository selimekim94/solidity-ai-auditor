When selling ('to == uniswapV2Pair'), if 'openedTrade' is true, it enforces 'mingas' (set to 5 wei). Since standard transaction gas prices are always higher than 5 wei, this logic forces a revert, effectively permanently pausing sell ability (Honeypot)."

      "description": "The contract uses obscure function names 'da51423' and '_transferBf' to hide malicious logic. These functions implement a gas price check ('tx.gasprice > _gas') that is designed to revert transactions silently, masking the honeypot mechanism from basic automated scanners."
